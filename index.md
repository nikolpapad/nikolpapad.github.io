## 🚀 My Projects

### 🧵 Project 1 – Tap classifcation on accelerometer data using Deep Learning
What if in order to take a call or change a sing you did a double tap on your face to avoid hurting you ear by tapping on your earbuds? 
This was exactly the motivation of my interniship at TDK InvenSence where 
I worked with time-series accelerometer data and build from scratch a Deep Learning model that classifies such gestures.

### 🤖 Project 2 – Experimenting with CycleGANs ;)
Exploring image-to-image translation using generative models through Kaggle competitions.
